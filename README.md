### Arthur Flam

Engineering leader & hands-on builder. ML background, startup DNA, full-stack range.

At **Samsung**, leading a multi-disciplinary platform team — MLOps, GenAI, DevOps, developer experience. Building the foundations other teams ship on.

I care about developer autonomy within guardrails, scaling engineering culture, and bridging silos — technical and human.

Most of what I build stays behind closed doors. What's here are traces.
